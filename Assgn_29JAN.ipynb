    " 1) import sys\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(sys.version)\n",
    " \n",
    " 2) import platform\n",

    "Ans. Benefits of using Python - \n",
    "   - Python is an open source platform and it has large active community base.\n",
    "   - It has variety of Libraries.\n",
    "   - It is Object Oriented Programming Language.\n",

    "   - It is both compiled ad intrepreted language.\n",
    "    \n",
    "14. How is Memory managed in Python?\n",
    "Ans. In Python memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic as the Python developers created a garbage collector for Python so that the user does not have to do manual garbage collection.\n",
    "When x = 10 is executed an integer object 10 is created in memory and its reference is assigned to variable x, this is because everything is object in Python.\n",
    "Here ,y = x will create another reference variable y which will refer to the same object because Python optimizes memory utilization by allocation the same object reference to a new variable if the object already exists with the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Is Indentation required in Python?\n",
    "Ans. Yes , Indentation is required in Python, Indentation differentiates a block of statement from simple statements."
